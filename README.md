# Z-Modem integration for iTerm2

## Preface

The purpose of this script is to add Z-Modem file transfer support to (in theory) any ssh session
from within iTerm2.

This script is inspired by and would probably not exist without the scripts "iterm2-recv-zmodem.sh" 
and "iterm2-send-zmodem.sh" (c) by Matt Mastracci, https://github.com/mmastrac/iterm2-zmodem. 

The motivation to not forking but rewriting the scripts was mainly to put the functionality into 
a single shell script to make it possible to share common code used by both sending and receiving 
funtionality and to make it more easy to extend the functionality in future.


## Installation

### Prework

For sending and receiving files the Z-Modem tools are required on both machines involved in the 
transfer. I recommend installing the lrzsz package which should be available in most Linux 
distributions or which can be downloaded and build from source from: 

http://ohse.de/uwe/software/lrzsz.html

- Install lrzsz on your mac:

```shell
sudo brew install lrzsz
```

A recent version of iTerm2 is required for Mac OS X to make things work, downloadable from:

http://www.iterm2.com/

Optionally the script supports Growl notifications. For this to work the Growl application and 
the additional tool "growlnotify" is needed.

### Installation and configuration

The script iterm2-zmodem should by copied to /usr/local/bin. 

- Set up two triggers in iTerm2's [preference] -> [profile] -> [advanced] -> [triggers] -> [edit]


    Regular expression: \*\*B0100
    Action:             Run Coprocess
    Parameters:         /usr/local/bin/iterm2-zmodem sz

    Regular expression: \*\*B00000000000000
    Action:             Run Coprocess
    Parameters:         /usr/local/bin/iterm2-zmodem rz

The script "iterm2-zmodem" tries to determine the names (lrz, rz, lsz, sz) and locations 
of the binaries of growlnotify and the Z-Modem tools. The pathes searched are: 
    
    /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
    
If the Z-Modem tools are installed in some unusual place, the path can be specified when 
configuring the triggers using the LRZSZ_PATH environment variable, the "Parameters" setting
of the trigger has to be modified in this case to become for example:

    Parameters:         LRZSZ_PATH=/opt/lrzsz/bin /usr/local/bin/iterm2-zmodem rz

## Usage

The file transfer is initiated on the remote machine by executing rz respectively lrz 
(for receiving a file on the remote machine) or by executing sz respectively lsz (for sending
a file to the remote machine). See the command usage information of the Z-Modem tools for 
additional details.

Note, that sending files will overwrite the destination file on the local machine, if it
already exists.
